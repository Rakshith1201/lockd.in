  <h1>Privacy Policy for lockd.in</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 19, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how <strong>lockd.in</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles user information. By using the lockd.in mobile application (“the App”), you agree to the terms outlined below.</p>

  <h3>1. No Data Collection</h3>
  <p>The App operates completely offline and does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive user data. No data is sent to external servers or third-party services.</p>

  <h3>2. No Use of Third-Party Services</h3>
  <p>The App does not integrate any third-party SDKs, analytics, or advertising platforms. All functionality runs locally on your device.</p>

  <h3>3. Permissions</h3>
  <p>The App may request access to usage data or certain device-level permissions solely to enable app-blocking features. These permissions are required for functionality but are not used to collect data in any way.</p>

  <h3>4. Open-Source Components</h3>
  <p>The App uses certain open-source codebases which are publicly available. These have been incorporated responsibly and without modification to user privacy expectations. We thank the contributors for their work.</p>

  <h3>5. International Use</h3>
  <p>This App is intended for use globally. However, users are responsible for ensuring that use of the App complies with local laws and regulations. We make no guarantees regarding compliance outside of the jurisdiction in which the developer resides.</p>

  <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
  <p>The App is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, express or implied. Under no circumstances shall we be held liable for any damages, direct or indirect, resulting from the use or inability to use the App, including but not limited to data loss, screen time mismanagement, or psychological impact.</p>

  <h3>7. Updates to this Policy</h3>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. The updated version will be available at the same location.</p>

  <h3>8. Contact</h3>
